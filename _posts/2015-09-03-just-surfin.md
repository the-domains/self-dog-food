# Just surfin'

While browsing the web to gather some ideas for my series of posts I
have come across several interesting critters. There seem to be at
least a thousand different ways to tagging and whenever I access such
a site, something interesting pops up. Mostly the interesting things
have been blog entries about web business. I am not interested in
making business myself but I do have a certain interest in the
process that creates new business in a fast growing and vague
environment like the web. There are lots of sites waiting to be
noticed, discussion about making money in services that cost nothing
to use and also a few challenges to create even more sites in a short
period of time. As I am a bit twisted as a personality, I will start
with the last one. Some of the first ones I will cover whilst writing
about the others.

I was surfing to see what ma.gnolia.com was all about and when
clicking the first link (which wasn't in an intuitive location!) I
came across \[Six Sites\]\[1\] and later on \[Every 5 Weeks\]\[2\]. Both
share the same idea: can you make a site once a month or two. When I
stumbled upon them, the latter was already finished. The sites they
created seem to be pretty generic \[RoR\]\[3\] sites but they are
\[LAMP\]\[4\] projects according to the front page. They did and did not
succeed in the quest: There are 12 sites released but four of them
are spin-offs from other sites.

The first one is \[Domain Log Book\]\[5\] which is designed for people
with umpteen domains who cannot keep track of what's where and which
expires when. It isn't filled with features. It is a simple service
that may be useful for somebody. The second one is \[FullSingle\]\[6\]
which is basically a meta site or an ode to single page sites. The
third site, \[überlook\]\[7\], is some sort of a web show-off post
service. It offers a feed from whatever is posted on the site. The
\[Weblog Tutorials\]\[8\] site is the same for weblog tutorial pages.
A pretty idea but I don't see a lot of content on either site. What's
wrong with a generic tagging engine? The next one, Most \[Hired\]\[9\],
is an aggregation site that collects the job offers from twenty-ish
job feeds and shows them on one page. \[Most Preview\]\[10\] does the
same for movie trailers. The next one is finally something a bit
different: a home run scoreboard, \[Home Run Happy\]\[11\]. The next,
\[Design by Grid\]\[12\], is a tutorial site. To avoid overdoing
aggregation, there is \[Me in One\]\[13\] that is a personal 
aggregation service. The sixth, or whatever the number, site is
\[I Worked On\]\[16\] and guess what, it's not launched yet. The next one
is [The Opinion Aggregator][0] which answers questions through means
of aggregation. The final site, \[Most Sliced\]\[16\], actually finally
catches a possible business opportunity for aggregation, it is a
portal for finding a slicing service. (Actually they have
mostcooked.com and mostlisted.com but they don't show up in the
schedule. They are, you guessed right, aggregation sites.)

After briefing the whole campaign in one paragraph, I keep meeting
the words aggregation and tagging. Neither are nothing new. None of
the sites looks really flashy or special either. I consider the
domain service somewhat useful, the design by grid has some real
value to it, the personal service is good for a limited audience 
providing a lot of content and the slicing service has a business 
angle. So, there are twelve sites out of which four have one main 
feature that catches my eye. I am happy with the reuse of components 
and the fact that making one site is big enough a project for one 
year. I am unhappy with the overuse of one idea and the lack of 
original innovation. I am an Open Source person with a heart for 
mash-ups and I am not seeing too much of a real effort. Flashy 
graphics or at least a defined look in a service is important to 
users. That is a big lesson to learn for these guys. I am not sure if 
any of these will fly but they are certainly in hiatus right now. 
Grasping a few good ideas with enough grinding does the job but I am 
not sure if they did any actual brainstorming.

After bashing these fine guys for a while I go on to this guy with
six sites in mind. I prefer him according to some grains of detail.
First of all I like his way of writing. He seems more like he is
talking to me, he is covering areas around the actual development
and he loves feedback. He has bolder ideas: he talked about making a
great RSS engine that would replace desktop ones for good. He sounds
more professional to say it in one sentence. The delivery date for
all sites is the same so I think they will be more finalized in the
end. I say this guy will pull it through!

Now to the business stuff and what I wanted to say about them: I came
across Paul Graham and a [essay][0] by him. He thinks about making
business while looking like non-profit for most of the users. This is
intuitive to most Open Source people. Other things I noticed about
the writing are the concepts (or names for old concepts) that I came
across in a seminar last autumn: \[Swarm Creativity\]\[18\] and
Coolhunting. Those are terms generated to grasp the ideas of finding
innovation and trends in virtual, distributed and electronic
communities. Both of these challenges and the essay have the intent
of first throwing some hooks and letting the "Swarm" or a flash crowd
decide where the business will be. In the modern web environment and
the world of Open Source we should not take the old business models
and pay-per-user for granted. I am happy to see people grasping that
finally but it seems that there will be lots of services simply born
to die as a side effect.
