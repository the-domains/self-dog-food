# FUTURE 1.1

I released a new version of my Ubuntu Encryption tool. I noticed some
nasty issues when installing my new laptop. One known bug remains and
I am trying to have the time to fix it.

    CHANGES 1.0 to 1.1
    
    - The script now forces the load of aes and sha256 modules in initramfs.
    - Disable the encrypted partitions in the previous install.
    

For now DON'T try to install on a system that does not use JFS as the
previous root partition. It won't boot.
