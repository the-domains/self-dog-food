# Iron Sky teaser is out!

A teaser trailer for Iron Sky, the next film from the makers of Star 
Wreck, is out at [ironsky.net][0]. I loved it! The best part of it
all is the community behind the project. Anyone can join the project
in form of ideas, concept art or whatever for the movie. Join the
cause at [Wreck a Movie][1]! Another way to help the process is
buying War Bonds at the Iron Sky website. For 50 euros you get a
bunch of promotional stuff and help the movie.

The numbers added up it seems they are getting one 25th of the budget
by selling 2000 sets of war bonds. Seems like a good way to collect
funds. Let's see what the business model is going to be like when the
first community-driven movie is coming out.
