# That was utterly unuseful, sorry

I noticed that the rc1 of the package works much better with the Dell 
Latitude D630 laptop than the rc3\. I packaged that during a break 
here in [Open Mind][0]. The new
[packages][1] fix at
least two issues: the mixer and mute actually work and the driver
comes back up after a suspend to RAM.
