# Encrypting Ubuntu, the lazy man's way

I have been running encrypted Ubuntu for two years. I have tried as 
many methods as I have made installations. I am still waiting for the 
option in the installer. I have repeated the steps so many times that 
I simply had to write them in a script. I can't say it is pretty or 
finished but it does what it's supposed to do. It moves a freshly 
installed Feisty Fawn onto an encrypted partition and encrypts the 
swap as well. Since it has been more than a week since I wrote the 
script, I have a thought about making a few fixes.

The script is available
[here][0].

Edit 2012-06-28: The link is dead and encryption eventually arrived
in Ubuntu alternative installation in a few years time. This post
remains as a historical reference.
