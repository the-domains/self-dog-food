# Openmind and MindTrek, day 2

Today we started with a plenary session. I missed the first 
presentation and arrived in the middle of the presentation by
_[Zak Greant][0]_. I rushed in when he was
talking about Open Source in general through the history of literate
machines. Once again an enjoyable talk. Today the Openmind people
were joined by the MindTrek people and the talk about Open Source has
moved to a more general level. The tracks today are Open Source,
Ubimedia, Social media, eGovernment and Games as Services. The last
speaker in the plenary session was _Dr. Mark Ollila_ from Nokia
speaking about Nokia's new approach to mobile gaming. They have
noticed a bunch of severe problems in the business. The first 
presentation, the one I missed was about
[Jaiku][1]. I have tried using that but it wasn't
any good considering the reduced battery life.

Ubimedia didn't sound interesting, eGovernment sounded like 
bureaucracy, I don't play that many games, hence I decided to go with 
the Open Source. The first presenter was from Sun, _Thorbiorn 
Fritzon._ He talked about the Sun's recent change of heart to open
most of its software. I hadn't dived so deep into the details and the
background was really interesting. I decided to find out what Social
media is. I went in in the middle of a presentation by _Bonnie Shaw_
from [Snap-Shot-City][2] about new 
ways to play. I had missed something and didn't follow at first but 
it seemed that people have created several games that bring the 
physical surroundings into the virtual community. That sounded 
interesting. The next presentation was by _Paavo BÃ¤ckman_ from
[Merceedes Productions][3]. He pointed out how 
they had promoted a record with the budget of 80 euros and actually 
got it played on the radio. They used only the current small 
community of the existing fanbase. Never underestimate virtual 
communities.

After lunch I returned to the Open Source track. The first part was
presented by _Amy Jiang_, Canonical. Surprisingly it was about 
Ubuntu. The presentation was spiced up a bit with information 
specific for the Ubuntu community in China. Currently I am listening 
to Toni Sormunen from Nokia talking about a smart home system that 
they have been able to create without falling into the seven potholes 
on the way. They are using an OpenWRT system and wireless devices. 
Unsurprisingly a S60 phone is also included in the picture. So far 
they have addressed the issues of power consumption and this seems to 
be a promising project enabled by the Open Source. Grreat propaganda! 
It seems though that smart office space is still a far-away dream. 
The next presentation is about the OLPC. I joined the cause in
[Facebook][4] (which is a buzzword 
here) and I am going to stop blogging just to respect the cause.
