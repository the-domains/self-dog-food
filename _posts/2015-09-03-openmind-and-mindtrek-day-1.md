# Openmind and MindTrek, day 1

I am currently taking part in [MindTrek][0]
which is a which is sort of a high tech conference arranged yearly
in Tampere. The whole of yesterday was a sub-event called Openmind
which was all about Open Source. I had a really good time and all of
the presentations I had time to see were utterly interesting. The day
started with a plenary session where all of us were sitting in a big
hall where _Petri Räsänen_ from [COSS][1]
delivered the opening words. It was really a delight meeting him in
person as he was originally scheduled for a speech in the first
seminar I arranged. Then there would be _Carlos E. Montero-Luque_
from Novell, _Monty Videnius_ from MySQL and Mr. 
To be announced from LiPS.

The Novell presentation was about convincing us that Novell has a
good intent in its actions. I remain undecided. Monty talked about
MySQL of course and he had MySQL hat tightly in his head. I remain
a PostgreSQL user. LiPS was all about providing a forum for remaking
what Openmoko has already accomplished. They were not going to
implement anything and reusing the good ideas in pre-existing
projects wasn't mentioned. It seems like competition for the sake of
competition but maybe people will have the chance to pick their
favorites.

After lunch the presentations continued in three tracks: Open Source
in Mobile, The art and magic of creating open source communities and
Adoption of Open Source and Standards in Public Sector. I took part
in all of them. First I ended up enjoying
_[Ari Jaaksi][2]_'s speech on the
challenges in mobile Linux. I missed a part of it by being a bit
slow. Enjoying is the best word to describe it. It was a perfect
start of a track with little new information. He sure is a brilliant
speaker. After Ari, the track continued with GPLv3 talk which
obviously made me discontinue listening. I changed to Public Sector
where _Carlos E. Montero-Luque_ was speaking about Novell's success
with the public sector. In his speech he mentioned that one of the
reasons for the public sector using Open solutions is the additional
freedom and control over the systems. That was pointed out in the
next presentation by _[Pasi Nieminen][3]_, my
boss, about the [Muuli][4] project which, 
although named after a non-reproductive animal, will have a 
continuation. The bottom line of the project was to create a Wiki for 
Finnish cities and municipalities about the options available in the 
public sector. I took part in the project by gathering the data for 
systems currently used by the City of Tampere. We had problems with 
some vendors not willing to actually tell us, people representing 
their customer, the most basic information about their systems.

For the final two presentations I stayed with the communities. First
was the presentation about Wippies, a community somewhat similar to
[FON][5]. I got my HomeBox for free in May and a
WifiBox a few months later. This was not the first or the last "I am
one!" feeling of the day. I also noticed that they have added some
features to the box at my parents' place. As a layman you could
disagree with the Wippies representative about the fast pace of
creating new features. Still, there is always something new when I
have a look at the site. Pretty amazing.

The next speaker was _Atte Joutsen_ from
[Star Wreck Studios][6]. He was
accompanied by _Tommi Ullgren_ from [Codento][7].
It's been more than a year since my last lunch with Tommi and it
seems that their company has since then worked fairly much with the
Open Source community. Currently Codento is helping Star Wreck
Studios with creating a community for creating high-quality
low-budget films. The studio is a spin-off from the studio behind
Star Wreck. Their first goal is to create films with effects and
models contributed by the active community they created almost
accidentally while making Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning. The main
point of the community, for now, is not giving away clock cycles SETI
style but actually giving anyone a chance to appear in a film at
least as a 3D model.

The day continued with the Summer Coders hired by COSS presenting
their summer's work. During the presentations I downloaded Exaile and 
Inkscape. They sound like something I could use. All of the four 
presentations presented a great job done by a young coder. The final 
presentation was by Jim Zemlin, better known as the boss of a Finnish 
kernel hacker. He is great with words. That was the most effective 
propaganda I've seen in a while and it affected me even though I am 
already a convert.

The night continued with discussing with members of the Finnish and
international Open Source community in a restaurant.
[Open Tuesday][8] paid for the
wine because it was Tuesday. A lot of topics were discussed, thoughts
were exchanged and I even got to touch a hacked iPhone. Yes, it isn't
a good phone and it has far too many security holes, some of them
intentional.

I was almost drowned in information but somehow I still had the
chance to do some coding. I am feeling efficient!
