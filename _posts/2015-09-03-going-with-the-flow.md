# Going with the flow

I thought I'd never go for a meme in this blog, but...

    herttoniemi:ferrix~
    2 $ history|awk '{a[$2]++ } END{for(i in a){print a[i] " " i}}'|sort -rn|head
    

    123 ls
    85 df
    65 cd
    32 ping
    26 sudo
    24 rm
    21 du
    17 exit
    13 ssh
    12 upslug2
