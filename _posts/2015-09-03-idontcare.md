# iDontCare

I already mentioned iPhone once on this site. I decided to mention it 
for the last time after marking Mark's
[words][0].
I don't know what drove me to his site. I used to read his blog from
time to time back in the day he had one. Apparently he has one again.
Anyway that was what anyone should have to say about iPhone. After
playing with one for two minutes, hearing what it doesn't have
iDontCare.
