# Why is it so hard?

I have been working with some VoIP solutions. I have been browsing my 
options and I always get into trouble with it. One solution is old 
but complicated, one is messy but commercially supported, one fits 
all my needs if I just get the moonphase right. Is it really so hard 
with PSTN telephony as well? Wouldn't it be beneficial to document 
the software so that a trained monkey can install it and administrate 
the whole telephone network?

Just tell me: Why can't there be a usable PBX with the features I want?

So what I need here is: TLS, SRTP, conferencing, voicemail, dialplans.
The problem is that what I really want is everything with TLS and SRTP 
signalling. Why is it so hard?
