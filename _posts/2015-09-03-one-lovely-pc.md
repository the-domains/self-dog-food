# One Lovely PC

As I mentioned yesterday, I had the privilege to be in the same room
with an [OLPC][0] device. I also had the privilege to
touch one. Apart from the wrapping, it seems to be a computer that
people are willing to do anything to get. It lasts for 12 hours of
use with a single charge and keeps up the mesh network for a week. It
has really good hardware and it is sturdy enough to stand against the
world of little monsters. It is a device that wants me to be a child
again. It is unfair for the adults that only the kids get such great
laptops. I wish my mobile phone would last for 12 hours. I wish my
laptop was so light. I wish I could get one. I wish everyone could
have one. You may say I'm a dreamer... but I am going to get one. It
is a sweet deal anyway. I am getting a nearly free laptop that is
sure to run Linux **and** a child somewhere gets one as
well.

I hereby promise that I buy an OLPC when they are available in Europe. 
In case they are not available in Europe in a reasonable time I will 
find out how to get one and help others to get theirs as well.
