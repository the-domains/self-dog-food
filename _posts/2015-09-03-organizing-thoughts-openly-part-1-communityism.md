# Organizing Thoughts Openly (part 1): Communityism

_This is part one of a series of posts called "Organizing Thoughts
Openly". In this series I search for solutions and software to help
in organizing thoughts and being the master of puppets on your
computer and the big bad Internet._

It has been almost a year since I got my first touch with \[Flock\]\[1\].
It is a browser that derives from Firefox and enhances it with
community features. A friend used it and liked it a lot. He is a bit
of a gadget freak, using lots of community sites (it took him months
to join \[Facebook\]\[2\] though) and I am mostly just an Open Source
enthusiast. I am not taking so many pictures and after all not many
of them end up on \[Flickr\]\[3\]. After reading the terms on Facebook, I
am definitely not uploading any of my images there. As an old friend
of IRC I am not so keen on all the new things like \[AIM\]\[4\] or
\[GoogleTalk\]\[5\]. I am pretty new to forums as well: I started on my
first one for leisure purposes roughly a year ago. \[LinkedIn\]\[6\] was
the first community I joined voluntarily without a doubt.

The features of Flock include: Facebook, \[YouTube\]\[7\], Flickr,
Twitter, Blogger, webmail and various other sorts of integration, an
RSS reader, a blogging tool, the Mozilla engine with a recognizeable
user interface. I have mine saut√©ed with my favourite Firefox
extensions.

So what does a guy like me get from Flock, the social browser? I
wouldn't describe myself as anti-social, I am an amateur stand-up act
for Pete's sake. I am not sure if I am comfortable telling people
that I am home again and I don't bother with mobile presence. If
somebody does give a toss, they know my mobile number or don't know
and are incapable of asking the number service. They might as well
ask me on mobile IRC which I use while using a form of public
transport. The intuitive answer for the question would be: nothing.
That's an easy guess but still a bit far fetched. I am not an active
content provider, unless you consider this blog active which it
actually is compared to most blogs which despite the great audience
and response die with a total of ten posts. I do like content, I
would love to have the time, the energy and the commitment to create
a lot myself.

The problem with content is that there is too much of it. It is too
easy to get caught in the avalanche and spend a few hours of the
precious working time doing absolutely nothing productive. In my case
of working from home, I have a rather strict view of what is billable
and what is not. After a few days with Flock I feel that I can
finally hide my communities during working hours and bring them up
with a single click to go with my coffee whenever I "need" them. I
can see that Flock can work as a part of the problem as well if you
use it with a wrong kind of philosophy. I couldn't imagine working
with a browser that has a constantly updating media bar and
everyone's Facebook status popping up every so and so minutes.

I have never been the first to jump on a bandwagon when it comes to
these hyped new communities. Someone has to invite me first. I know
it has its cons as well: it took me until yesterday to join
\[del.icio.us\]\[8\]. I first met with it as late as a few months ago and
for a bloke running several computers in parallel and constantly
missing a synchronization feature in Firefox, it was an
earth-rumbling experience. The browser plug-in, even while taking a
lot of space, has now almost completely replaced my bookmark tool
bar. I love adding pages to my toread tag so that I can actually
remember to read them when I am not working.

Results: I give Flock a thumbs-up for moving my communities to a
single sidebar. The blog feature gets a high-five in case this post
succeeds. Missing Ubuntu packaging and 32-bit-only tar-balls are a
turnoff. Combined with del.icio.us and my favourite plug-ins I have
high hopes that I will one day feel organized again.

_The next post will be about keeping your calendar and time
management devices in sync. You may make suggestions for any future
post by email or commenting._
